The answer here suggests to load the image in an Image object and check for it's width and height properties to be non zero.\nI think the technique can be used to solve your problem too.  I also worked out a fiddle for you to refer. Pertinent code below:  var img = new Image();\nimg.addEventListener(\"load\",function(){\n  alert('success');\n});\nimg.addEventListener(\"error\",function(){\n      alert('error');\n});\n  img.src = picFile.result; ", "question_id": 29805909}, "0.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.137795390.13779539"], [{"answer_votes": "30", "answer_comments": [" God, why I haven't thought about this?
